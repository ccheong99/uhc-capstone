It involves cutting away thin layers of skin until there are no signs of cancer left. Following surgery, careful treatment is required to minimize the risk of infection and avoid other problems.</p>

                    <p>To answer these questions, we conducted a comprehensive research series that help us step into the world of wound care. Most excitingly, we began with a one-week empathy study to put ourselves in patients' shoes and become familiar with general wound care procedures. We also conducted site visits where we interacted with patients and healthcare providers in clinical settings to identify various touch points in this journey. Additionally, we interviewed both healthcare providers and patients to uncover pain points from both perspectives, and with speed dating sessions we showcased our ideas to explore hidden needs and potential design directions worth pursuing.</p>

                                <p class = "evidence-text">During interviews with subject-matter experts, 7 out of 9 people highlighted the importance of  reassurance in patient interactions. One nurse mentioned, “It’s important to reassure them because people might easily forget or feel nervous.” Similarly, another nurse said, “I always encourage patients, especially those living alone with challenging wound locations, to call me for feedback, reassurance, or further counseling.”</p>

                                <p class = "evidence-text">The literature indicates that patients are reassured when they know that nurses are nearby or easy to reach. At the Cleveland Clinic, phone calls are the primary way patients seek reassurance. In speed dating sessions, 14 out of 16 patients said they would first call nurses or doctors if they encountered problems. Many patients expressed discomfort with chatbots or mobile apps, preferring direct interaction with medical personnel.</p>

                            <p class = "insight-text">Our solution aims to balance the need for patients to be reassured without imposing unnecessary burden on medical personnel. It does so by providing patients with more relevant, personalized instructions, including information about potential complications and how to deal with them. This includes instructions for when to seek help from medical personnel. In addition, we also introduce a proposal for a chatbot solution for those patients who are comfortable using such technology. The chatbot would need to be thoroughly vetted and include appropriate guardrails to ensure it can safely be deployed in such a context.</p>

The final day brought a mix of relief and reflection, and we were able to connect even further with our project.</p>

For us this space was the waiting room of the clinic as we saw this as an opportunity to empathize with patients’ experience beyond what happens in the appointment room. To conduct this activity we each went out, one at a time, into the waiting room for approximately 10 minutes and observed a different AEIOU element. We did this each once in the morning, and once in the afternoon.</p>

                <p class = "popup-text">The opportunity to visit the University Hospitals clinic allowed us to delve into the experiences of both the patients and the health care providers. We prepared tailored interview questions for both, focusing on the key themes we had generated in the first phase of our research. These questions guided our conversations and helped us to uncover valuable insights.<br><br>
                    From the patients we understood that they were leaving the clinic with very high levels of confidence. At the same time however, we were hearing from the nurses that they were receiving numerous calls from patients who seemed to be seeking reassurance once they were home. There was a clear misalignment in patients’ perceptions of their confidence, and their actual wound care proficiency.</p>

                <p class = "popup-text">Prior to interview sessions, we developed interview guides tailored for healthcare professionals to meet our objectives. Then, we recruited 6 nurses from the University Hospitals of Cleveland, along with 2 nurses and 1 dermatologist from University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Given logistical limitations, we conducted the interviews remotely. Each session followed a semi-structured format, with one facilitator and one note-taker present, and lasted approximately 40 minutes each.</p>
                <div class = "popup-subtitle">WHAT WE LEARNED</div>
                <p class = "popup-text">Through the expert interviews, we had new findings about communication channels, observed patient pain points, patient expectations, instructions, and emerging technology. First, we learned that primary communication is through the electronic portal, Epic, with rare patient calls and messages mainly for reassurance or infection concerns. Also, according to healthcare professionals, indicators for patient calls included anxiety, confusion, and repeated questions, with some redness considered normal in wound healing. Patients may struggle with assessing wounds at home, adhering to instructions, and accessing appropriate medication and home nursing. While patients are expected to reach out if they experience unexpected pain or significant changes in wound characteristics, healthcare professionals also commonly mentioned patients calling for reassurance. Lastly, when asked about emerging technology regarding wound care, plasma injections and stem cell therapies were brought up.</p>
