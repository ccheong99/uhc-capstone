                    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6TxdvjPk5I" style = "text-decoration: underline; margin-right: 2px;">Mohs surgery↗</a> is essentially a procedure that involves removing the cancer tissues layer by layer. After being removed, each layer is sent to an on-site lab to determine if further layers need to be removed. While waiting for the result of each layer, patients typically need to wait for about 30 minutes to an hour.</p>
                    <p>Below is an initial patient journey map that we created to understand the patient's experience and emotions from the discovery stage to healing, and opportunities that may be found along the way.</p>

                    <p>To answer these questions, we conducted a comprehensive research series that help us step into the world of wound care. Most excitingly, we began with a one-week empathy study to put ourselves in patients' shoes and become familiar with general wound care procedures. We also conducted site visits where we interacted with patients and healthcare providers in clinical settings to identify various touch points in this journey. Additionally, we interviewed both healthcare providers and patients to uncover pain points from both perspectives, and with speed dating sessions we showcased our ideas to explore hidden needs and potential design directions worth pursuing.</p>

                            <p class = "insight-text">To truly enhance wound care outcomes, it is important to extend personalization beyond the clinic setting by anticipating patients' needs during the immediate post-discharge period. For example, anticipating patients' cognitive ability entails recognizing that some individuals may require simplified instructions or additional support to comprehend and adhere to their wound care regimen effectively. Additionally, considering variations in patients' health and technology literacy levels, as well as their learning preferences, healthcare providers may offer materials in diverse mediums and modalities.

As Nurse 2 emphasized, “The goal is to make them (patients) feel confident about understanding the wound care procedure before they leave the clinic.” To achieve this, some nurses would streamline the information provided, focusing only on the essential steps of wound care while disregarding the rest about handling complications. For example, Nurse 4 mentioned that “I personally will only go over the first page. Most the information is on it, including what to do within the first week after surgery.” </p>

                            <p class = "insight-text">Therefore, other than continually making patients feel in control, we also want them to acknowledge that uncertainty is a natural part of the wound healing process, and more mindful of the potential complications that might arise as well as the corresponding ways to deal with them.

                                <p class = "evidence-text">In our interviews with experts, N out of 9 interviewees emphasized the importance of reassurance in their interactions with patients. In an interview, Nurse 2 emphasized that “it’s important to reassure them because people might easily forget or feel nervous.” Similarly, Nurse 5 quoted that “I always encourage patients, especially those living alone with challenging wound locations, to call me for feedback, reassurance, or further counseling.”</p>

                                <p class = "evidence-text">According to Fareed's literature, patients often find reassurance when they feel nurses are simply 'there' for them, whether physically or easily accessible. At the Cleveland Clinic, phone call was the most common way patients sought reassurance. In speed dating sessions, 14 out of 16 patients stated they would first call nurses and doctors if they encountered any problems. Meanwhile, when asked about leveraging emerging technology like chatbots or mobile apps, many patients expressed discomfort and a lack of trust, indicating a preference for direct interaction.</p>

                                <p class = "evidence-text">We discovered that patients heavily rely on calls due to their immense trust in healthcare providers' expertise and understanding of their situations. Patient 1 emphasized this trust, saying, “Usually, what they say can happen is what happens. If they tell me I can shower, I shower. Just like they told me.” Patient 8 echoed this sentiment, stating, “The doctor knows me, so I'd trust him. Right now, he is the expert.”</p>

                            <p class = "insight-text">Therefore, other than continually making patients feel in control, we also want them to acknowledge that uncertainty is a natural part of the wound healing process, and more mindful of the potential complications that might arise as well as the corresponding ways to deal with them. By preparing patients to expect and handle potential complications, we aim to reduce anxiety and empower them with problem-solving skills to navigate challenges effectively throughout their recovery journey.</p>

Adapting to new routines, confronting societal misunderstandings, and managing persistent itchiness exposed us to some experiences that a patient would face during the post-operative recovery stage. The final day brought a mix of relief and reflection, and we were able to connect even further with our project.</p>

For us this space was the waiting room of the clinic as we saw this as an opportunity to empathize with patients’ experience beyond what happens in the appointment room. To conduct this activity we each went out, one at a time, into the waiting room for approximately 10 minutes and observed a different AEIOU element. We did this each once in the morning, and once in the afternoon.</p>
                <p class = "popup-text">In one day of interviews we had the opportunity to speak with seven patients. These selfless patients allowed us to speak with them, in teams of two and three, during their visit to the clinic. </p>

                <div class = "popup-subtitle">WHAT WE LEARNED</div>
                <p class = "popup-text">The opportunity to visit the University Hospitals clinic allowed us to delve into the experiences of both the patients and the health care providers. We prepared tailored interview questions for both, focusing on the key themes we had generated in the first phase of our research. These questions guided our conversations and helped us to uncover valuable insights.<br><br>
                    From the patients we understood that they were leaving the clinic with very high levels of confidence. At the same time however, we were hearing from the nurses that they were receiving numerous calls from patients who seemed to be seeking reassurance once they were home. There was a clear misalignment in patients’ perceptions of their confidence, and their actual wound care proficiency.</p>

                <p class = "popup-text">Prior to interview sessions, we developed interview guides tailored for healthcare professionals to meet our objectives. Then, we recruited 6 nurses from the University Hospitals of Cleveland, along with 2 nurses and 1 dermatologist from University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Given logistical limitations, we conducted the interviews remotely. Each session followed a semi-structured format, with one facilitator and one note-taker present, and lasted approximately 40 minutes each.</p>
                <div class = "popup-subtitle">WHAT WE LEARNED</div>
                <p class = "popup-text">Through the expert interviews, we had new findings about communication channels, observed patient pain points, patient expectations, instructions, and emerging technology. First, we learned that primary communication is through the electronic portal, Epic, with rare patient calls and messages mainly for reassurance or infection concerns. Also, according to healthcare professionals, indicators for patient calls included anxiety, confusion, and repeated questions, with some redness considered normal in wound healing. Patients may struggle with assessing wounds at home, adhering to instructions, and accessing appropriate medication and home nursing. While patients are expected to reach out if they experience unexpected pain or significant changes in wound characteristics, healthcare professionals also commonly mentioned patients calling for reassurance. Lastly, when asked about emerging technology regarding wound care, plasma injections and stem cell therapies were brought up.</p>
