                <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6TxdvjPk5I" style = "text-decoration: underline;">Mohs surgery↗</a> is essentially a procedure that involves removing the cancer tissues layer by layer. After being removed, each layer is sent to an on-site lab to determine if further layers need to be removed. While waiting for the result of each layer, patients typically need to wait for about 30 minutes to an hour.</p>

                    <p>As we continued to analyze and synthesize the data we had collected over the course of the semester it became clear that we were faced with a different problem than we had originally set out to solve: the patient’s inability to deal with unexpected situations, and the lack of easily accessible, personalized information, are the main causes of poor surgical outcomes and healthcare providers’ burden.</p>

                    <p>To answer these questions, we conducted a comprehensive research series that help us step into the world of wound care. Most excitingly, we began with a one-week empathy study to put ourselves in patients' shoes and become familiar with general wound care procedures. We also conducted site visits where we interacted with patients and healthcare providers in clinical settings to identify various touch points in this journey. Additionally, we interviewed both healthcare providers and patients to uncover pain points from both perspectives, and with speed dating sessions we showcased our ideas to explore hidden needs and potential design directions worth pursuing.</p>

Armed with wound care kits and at-home care procedures, we embraced the responsibility of maintaining the initial dressings for the first 48 hours and changing our bandages daily for the next four days.</p>
                <p class = "popup-text">During this brief wound-care simulation, each of us shared our daily thoughts and reflections with each other, highlighting challenges and certain experiences woven into our daily lives. From navigating instructions on an Apple Watch to facing changed perceptions of facial expressions and social interactions, this experience became a profound exploration of both physical and emotional dimensions. Adapting to new routines, confronting societal misunderstandings, and managing persistent itchiness exposed us to some experiences that a patient would face during the post-operative recovery stage. The final day brought a mix of relief and reflection, and we were able to connect even further with our project.</p>
